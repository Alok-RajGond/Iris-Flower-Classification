## Introduction

The main objective of this project is to build a machine learning model that can learn from the measurements of iris flower species and accurately classify them. The K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm is used for this classification task.

## Usage

To run the analysis and train the iris flower species classification model, follow these steps:

1. Open a Jupyter Notebook or any Python IDE within the activated environment.
2. Open the Iris_Flower_Classification.ipynb notebook.
3. Run the notebook cells sequentially to execute the code.
4. Note: The notebook includes detailed explanations and comments to guide you through each step of the analysis.

## Data Preprocessing

The data preprocessing step involves handling missing values, data normalization, and splitting the dataset into training and testing sets. This ensures that the data is in a suitable format for the KNN algorithm.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

EDA is performed to gain insights into the iris dataset. Visualizations such as scatter plots, histograms, and correlation matrices are used to understand the relationships between different measurements and the iris species. This step helps in identifying patterns and potential outliers.

## Feature Engineering

Feature engineering techniques are applied to enhance the performance of the KNN model. These techniques include dimensionality reduction, feature selection, and creating new features based on domain knowledge.

## K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Algorithm

The KNN algorithm is implemented to classify the iris flower species based on the provided measurements. The notebook explains the working of the KNN algorithm, including distance metric selection, choosing the optimal value of K, and model training.

## Model Evaluation

The performance of the trained KNN model is evaluated using various evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Techniques like cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning are employed to ensure robust model performance.

## Model Deployment

The trained KNN model can be deployed to make predictions on new, unseen iris flower measurements. The notebook provides instructions on saving and loading the model, along with sample code for making predictions.

## Documentation and Resources

This repository includes well-documented code and explanations to help users understand the concepts behind the KNN algorithm and its application to iris species classification.!
